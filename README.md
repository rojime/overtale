# overtale
This is just a little game made in raw Javascript for a school project. It uses sprites from the game Undertale, and it is a mix of RPG style game and Platform-Parkour game. 
Feel free to do whatever you want with the code, as it is not some super cool and complicated code. It may have bugs, and the code may not be as clean as it could be.
I appreciate all feedback possible, and any help with the bugs or making the code cleaner is Welcome.
